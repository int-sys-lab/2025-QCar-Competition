Step 1: Download the pretrained Tensorflow model from the following Google Drive link and keep it in the " code " folder
https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Y2dmPriDlKzzIugDJJ05tABp2itTuN0/view?usp=sharing

Step 2: Work on the code
  - I am modeling our neural network off of this teams: https://github.com/SoumyajitC-24/Quanser-2024-ACC-Competition/blob/main/code/main.py

  -Here are the libraries that need to be imported

Notes: 

-Keras can be used to:
Load a prebuilt dataset.
Build a neural network machine learning model that classifies images.
Train this neural network.
Evaluate the accuracy of the model.

-import TensorFlow into the program to start

Installing TensorFlow

-https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip

You can install TensorFlow with Python's pip package manager:

"# Requires the latest pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Current stable release for CPU and GPU
pip install tensorflow

# Or try the preview build (unstable)
pip install tf-nightly"

-Install Additional Libraries:
  If you are using TensorFlow Hub for pretrained models or need other libraries, you can install them with:
"pip install tensorflow-hub
pip install opencv-python
pip install matplotlib"

-Install Keras (although it's part of TensorFlow 2.x, you can ensure it's installed separately):

Run this command:
pip install keras

Install Other Dependencies:
You'll need OpenCV, Matplotlib, and Pandas (these are included in your main.py):
pip install opencv-python matplotlib pandas

-Step 2: Set Up Your TensorFlow Model (Traffic Light & Traffic Sign Detection)
From your provided code, the neural network is already set up using TensorFlow and Keras.

Hereâ€™s the relevant portion for setting up the Traffic Light Classifier (TLClassifier) and Traffic Sign Classifier (TSClassifier):

The rest would be using the other teams code and modifying it to work with ours, here is just a portion of it

#---------------Added imports for Tensorflow models-------

from PIL import Image
from model import TLClassifier, download_model, load_graph, select_boxes, crop_roi_image,TSClassifier
import keras 
from keras import layers
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#Intializing the Tensorflow Models for Traffic Sign & Traffic Light Detection
tlc=TLClassifier() #For Traffic light detection

tsc = TSClassifier()#For Traffic Sign detection

# Initializing the Tensorflow Model for Traffic Light Classification
base_model = keras.applications.Xception(
    weights="imagenet",  # Load weights pre-trained on ImageNet.
    input_shape=(150, 150, 3),
    include_top=False,
) 
base_model.trainable = False
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(150, 150, 3))
scale_layer = keras.layers.Rescaling(scale=1 / 127.5, offset=-1)
x = scale_layer(inputs)
x = base_model(x, training=False)
x = keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = keras.layers.Dropout(0.2)(x)  # Regularize with dropout
outputs = keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
base_model.trainable = True

model_folder = os.path.dirname(__file__)

model_path = os.path.join(model_folder, 'newModel.weights.h5')
